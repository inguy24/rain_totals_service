    Rain Totals Extension for WeeWX
    
    This extension provides a service that automatically calculates and stores
    rain totals aggregated by week, month, and year. The service:
    
    - Supports both MySQL and SQLite databases
    - Creates three tables: archive_week_raintotal, archive_month_raintotal, archive_year_raintotal
    - Processes data incrementally for efficiency
    - Runs automatically as part of the WeeWX data processing pipeline
    
    The service is designed to work with existing WeeWX installations and
    requires no additional configuration beyond installation.
